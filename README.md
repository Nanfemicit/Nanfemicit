Hello, I am Ruth Femicit Dala and this is my Data & Environmental Science Portfolio

Welcome to my my learning journey!

I am currentlty an Earth Sciences MSc student with a growing passion for data, sustainability, and spatial analysis. This portfolio tracks my journey into data analysis, environmental modelling, and interdisciplinary research using tools like Python, QGIS, and more.

I created this space to showcase what I’m learning, how I’m applying it, and the kinds of problems I care about contributing solutions for.
